1 > blue-hour beach scene, person wearing a white linen shirt, soft ocean wind moving the hair, calm sea and horizon in background, realistic lighting and shadows, emotional melancholic mood — create a single photo composed of three horizontal frames: first frame from behind looking at the sea, second frame holding a bouquet of white flowers and looking down, third frame a close-up of the face softly lit by flash light — identical color grading, blue tones, film grain aesthetic, ultra-realistic detail, 8k resolution, same composition and atmosphere as a cinematic film still. 

2 > Create a vertical frame (2160x3840 pixels, 4K quality) divided into three equal horizontal segments forming a cinematic photo strip. The scene follows a young male
character inspired by the reference - same hairstyle, facial structure, and gentle yet expressive presence. The mood should radiate nostalgia, melancholy, and soft emotional depth.Overall Mood & Color Palette: Cold and muted tones with a slight blue-gray tint, gentle natural lighting (early dawn or twilight). The background should evoke loneliness, calm, and reflection. Soft focus and bokeh effects to enhance emotional realism.
Image 1(Top - Rear View Portrait):The character stands at the edge of a vast seashore, facing the ocean, wearing a loose white shirt fluttering in the breeze. The sea stretches endlessly with soft waves under a pale sky. His posture reflects peace mixed with sorrow - shoulders
slightly lowered. The scene feels cinematic, with a shallow depth of field and cool tones.Image 2 (Middle - Medium Shot):
The character holds a small bouquet of white roses close to his chest, looking down thoughtfully. The sea and sand form the backdrop, slightly
blurred. His expression conveysquiet sadness and longing, illuminated by soft ambient light.
Gentle mist or faint fog adds
atmosphere.
Image 3 (Bottom -Close-Up):A close-up of his face, eyes reflecting emotion - deep,
sorrowful, yet calm. The focus is on his eyes and subtle facial features, with the sea still visible in the
blurred background. Every detail from the soft lighting to the wind tousling his hair, emphasizes a
serene, emotional narrative.
Composition Style:
Cinematic, moody, natural lighting, shallow depth of field, filmic texture,
bokeh background, color grading in cool tones (bluish-gray).
Use a photorealistic style with emotional storytelling similar to a still frame from an indie film.
