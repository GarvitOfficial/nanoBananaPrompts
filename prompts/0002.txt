I am sitting indoors, captured in a cinematic close-up portrait. My upper body is slightly turned at an angle to the camera, while my head is rotated to the right, as I gaze past the frame with a thoughtful, almost surprised expression. My posture is upright yet relaxed, with my shoulders angled away from the lens. My arms and hands are not visible in the frame, keeping the focus entirely on my face and upper torso.I am wearing a light beige knitted sweater with a round neckline. The fabric is textured and soft, with visible stitching that catches the light, giving the outfit a casual but refined look. The sweater has a loose, comfortable fit without any additional accessories. I also wear thin, round metal-framed eyeglasses that add a subtle intellectual and stylish touch, reflecting a hint of the warm light source. The camera captures me at eye level, framed in a tight portrait crop that includes my shoulders and chest. The focal length resembles a classic 85mm portrait lens, giving natural compression and cinematic proportions. The lighting is dramatic and directional, with warm golden-hour sunlight falling across the left side of my face and sweater, creating strong highlights. The right side of my face falls into deeper shadow, enhancing contrast and sculpting my features. The background is softly blurred and dark, with no distinct details, emphasizing the subject and adding depth to the scene. The overall mood is cinematic, atmospheric, and intimate, combining warm golden tones with high contrast between light and shadow, perfectly capturing a quiet, reflective moment.
