Create a photorealistic, high-resolution portrait of a young woman( based on the reference photo, 100 percent face match) with a soft, ethereal aesthetic. The subject is centered and gazing off the camera. Young woman, appearing to be in her late teens or early twenties. Symmetrical, delicate features with high cheekbones and a soft, youthful jawline. Striking almond-shaped eyes with bright, piercing deep brown irises and well-defined, dark lashes. The eyebrows are naturally shaped and deep brown. Full, subtly defined lips with a matte, dusty-rose or soft-pink lipstick color. Long smooth hair, soft layers with blowout look. The color is a natural-looking black with subtle brown highlights. Serene, neutral, and gentle expression. Wearing a simple white lace or subtly textured strap visible on the shoulder. A single, small white pearl stud earring is worn in the visible ear. Soft, studio-quality, diffused lighting that minimizes harsh shadows, giving the skin a smooth, almost porcelain quality. The light source appears to be front-facing or slightly off-center, creating a soft glow. Plain, light-to-medium muted gray or blue-gray background. Shallow depth of field (bokeh) to keep the focus entirely on the subject, blurring the background into a smooth wash of color. Ethereal, dreamy, soft-focus quality typical of high-end beauty photography or art station portraits. Emphasis on realistic skin texture (subtle pores, light natural glow) despite the overall smooth appearance, indicating a high level of detail. Photorealistic, cinematic lighting, ultra detailed, 8k, high quality.
