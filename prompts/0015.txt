Create a captivating close-up, studio portrait of a young woman (based on the reference photo). Her hair is black, long, wavy light soft layered with slight bangs and highlights brown color, cascading over her shoulders and down her back.. Her gaze is direct and intense, with a slight tilt to her head. Vibrant, high-contrast neon lighting, utilizing a split-lighting technique. The dominant light source is an intense, saturated magenta-pink coming from the left, casting a strong glow on her hair and face. A secondary, cool cyan-blue light acts as a rim or fill light, highlighting the edges of her face and features from the right/back. The neon colors are intensely illuminating the subject. High dynamic range (HDR) to emphasize the difference between the bright lights and the shadows. Flawless, dewy skin with a high-gloss sheen on the cheekbones, nose, and chin, reflecting the colored light. Glossy, plump pink lips with a subtle sheen. She is wearing a simple corset top, barely visible. Neo-futuristic, cyberpunk portraiture, editorial fashion photography. Shot with a high-end full-frame camera (e.g., Canon EOS R5 or Sony a1). 85mm f/1.4 or 50mm f/1.2 prime lens. Shallow depth of field (bokeh), focusing sharply on the eyes and lips, with the background softly blurred to streaks of neon color. Ultra-high detail, 8k. Negative Prompts: ugly, deformed, bad anatomy, disfigured, poorly drawn face, mutated, extra limbs, watermark, text, signature, low resolution.
