Create an extreme close-up, vertical portrait of a woman's profile(based on the reference photo), captured with dramatic lighting. She is wearing a flowy white off shoulder dress barely visible.

The woman has her eyes closed and her face is tilted slightly upward and back, as if basking in sunlight. Her features are soft and defined by the strong light. Her hair is long, black and styled in a 90's blowout and appears to be swaying in the breeze, the hair strands flowing in the wind adding a sense of movement to the image. The lighting is the most striking element. A warm, golden light—likely from a sunset or window—falls intensely on the right side of her face, neck, and hair, creating a sharp contrast with the deeply shadowed background on the left. chiaroscuro, highlights the contours of her nose, lips, and neck, giving the image a rich, ethereal, and artistic quality. The background is mostly a dark, indistinct brown or gray, which makes the illuminated profile stand out even more. The image conveys a feeling of serenity, warmth, and quiet contemplation.
