Create A close-up, high-detail, photorealistic portrait of a young woman (, based on the reference photo). She has smooth and long, wavy black soft layered hair with voluminous curtain bangs, highlights, cascading over her shoulders and down her back. The subject has an intense and direct gaze with striking brown eyes. She wears a glossy pink lipstick with clean, defined edges. Her eye makeup features a warm, fiery gradient: a shimmering gold eyeshadow concentrated on the lid and crease, blended out to a softer transition color, complementing the lip. A soft wink eyeliner and defined lashes. The eyebrows are well-groomed and naturally filled. Her complexion is smooth and luminous, with a soft application of peachy blush high on the cheekbones, extending up to the temples, and subtle dewy highlight on the bridge of the nose, inner corner of the eyes, and cupid's bow. She is wearing borad straps wine color satin cowl-neck top. A tiny silver stud earring is visible in her left earlobe. The lighting is dramatic and warm, like the golden hour. A strong, directional light source from the upper right illuminates her face, creating a distinct sharp shadow on the left side of her face and background. The background is a nearly solid, deep black or dark shadow, providing high contrast and making the subject pop. The image has a shallow depth of field (bokeh effect) to keep the focus entirely on her face. Clean, sharp focus, cinematic quality, high resolution, detailed skin texture, editorial makeup photography.
