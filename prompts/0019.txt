A stunning, hyper-detailed portrait of a young woman ( based on the reference photo, 100 percent face match) with long, wavy light soft layered with slight curtain bangs and brown highlights ,black hair cascading over her shoulders and down her back. She has a soft, natural blush on her cheeks and a subtle sunkissed glow. Her makeup is elegant and minimal: a soft, neutral eyeshadow look with defined lashes, and full lips with a pink glossy finish. She has striking deep brown eyes with a direct, slightly dreamy or wistful gaze looking just off-camera to the side. She is wearing a corset dress in a light peach or dusty rose color. The lighting is warm, golden hour sunlight coming from the side, creating soft highlights. Background: A softly blurred (bokeh) background featuring deep green foliage (like hedges or trees) and the indistinct, light-colored architecture. Style: Photorealistic, shot on a high-resolution film camera (like a Contax T2 or similar), with a slight vintage film grain and a warm, desaturated color palette. Camera/Technical Details: Shot with an 85mm lens at a wide aperture (f/1.4 or f/1.8), creating an extremely shallow depth of field. Professional studio photography, ultra-detailed, cinema lighting, cinematic.
