Make an ultra-realistic and high-end personal portrait of the person in the photo provided, preserving their unique appearance, age, gender, skin tone, hair, eyes and expression. Negative: Do not distort traits, no age or gender changes, no sensitive skin, no make-up clothing (except for the backrest indicated), no extra or missing fingers, no noise, no texting or watermarking. Photorealistic textures of skin, hair and fabric. A woman with loose, slightly misaligned hair with a dark brown shade. The hair is brightly illuminated from behind, creating a luminous golden halo that contrasts sharply with the dark background. He turns his face towards the camera, looking straight but partially covered by shadows. His mouth is slightly ajar, adding an expressive and intimate air to the image. The delicate contour and the thin strap of an almost imperceptible garment suggest an artistic portrait, more sensual than documentary. Very strong and hot background light, probably with a yellow/orange gel, which wraps around the hair contour. A cold red fountain (pink / purple) illuminates the face and part of the chest, creating a complementary color contrast (hot in the hair, cold in the skin). The background is completely dark, completely isolating the model and highlighting the reflections of her hair. The image explores a warm-cold two-color scheme. The result is dramatic, cinematic and with an ethereal touch. Fixed lens (prime), between 50mm and 85mm in full frame format. This can be deduced from the soft compression of the face and shoulders, typical of portrait lenses. Wide aperture (f / 1.4 - f / 2.8). Artistic portrait with strong dramatic intention.
