A cinematic knee-length photo of a young man leaning casually on a garden railing during a night garden party, captured in Leica cinema film grade with a 50mm anamorphic lens. He wears a tucked-in full sleeve black shirt with sleeves folded, off-white cotton pants, a black belt, formal shoes, and a silver watch. His pose is stylish and relaxed, with one hand in his pocket and the other resting gently on the railing. He wears a light, innocent smile and maintains a natural, calm expression.

The background features softly glowing fairy lights and subtle garden décor, with no people in the frame, creating a serene and cinematic ambiance. The image has rich color tones, natural film grain, and shallow depth of field, giving a warm, candid, and elegant feel. Preserve 100% Face.
