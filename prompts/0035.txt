A young man standing beside a matte-black Gulfstream G700 jet and a black Rolls-Royce Phantom on an airport runway at sunset, wearing a sleek black suit with a fitted black shirt, tailored black trousers, black Chelsea boots, a black belt with a silver buckle, and a silver automatic wristwatch. He stands with one hand in his pocket and a calm, confident expression. Red-blue sunset tones fill the sky. Leica cinema-style flash photo, sharp luxury editorial vibe.
