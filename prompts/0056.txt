Create a picture of this woman unchanged her feature face Subject: A stylish young woman posing outdoors with a scenic coastal background. She is looking back over her shoulder towards the viewer, with a confident and chic expression. Natural makeup brown contour and highlight, rose lip color.

Hair: Long, luscious Light brown hair styled in soft, voluminous waves, with some strands gently swept back by the breeze, adding a dynamic element to the image. Dress & Style: She is wearing a light blue, possibly striped or textured, halter-neck or strapless top with a ruffled or layered detail. The fabric appears light and airy, suitable for a warm climate. Accessories: Sunglasses: Fashionable dark, oval-shaped sunglasses with a substantial frame. Handbag: A classic black quilted handbag with a gold chain strap, likely a high-end designer bag (reminiscent of Chanel). The bag is worn over her shoulder, resting against her side. Jewelry: A delicate gold ring is visible on her right hand, which is raised to adjust her sunglasses or playfully touch her hair. Vibe & Emotion: The overall vibe is one of sophisticated vacation, luxury, and relaxed glamour. Her pose and expression convey confidence, allure, and a sense of enjoying a beautiful destination.

Lighting: Bright and natural sunlight, typical of a clear day. The lighting creates subtle highlights on her hair and skin, and casts gentle shadows, giving depth to the scene. Colors: The dominant colors are the vibrant blue of the sea and sky, the lush greens of the foliage, the light tones of the road, and the woman's dark hair and black accessories contrasted by her light blue top.

Background: A stunning coastal landscape with a clear, calm blue sea extending to the horizon. In the distance, faint outlines of mountains or hills are visible. The foreground features a well-maintained pathway or road flanked by green, manicured bushes and mature trees (possibly pines). There are hints of white buildings or structures in the distance near the coastline, suggesting a resort or upscale area. Camera Angle & Composition: The shot is a medium-close up, focusing on the woman from the waist up. The camera is positioned slightly below eye level, which can be flattering. The composition places her slightly off-center, with the expansive sea and sky providing a beautiful and balanced backdrop. The winding road leads the eye towards the distant water.

Photography Style: The image appears to be high-resolution, with sharp focus on the subject and a natural, vibrant color palette. It has the feel of a candid yet perfectly styled travel or fashion photograph, capturing a moment of effortless elegance.
